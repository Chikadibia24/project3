          <p class="documentation-text">
            The training has been great so far.
          </p>

          <p class="documentation-text">
            We have learned some basic and advanced <strong>HTML</strong>,
            <strong>Git</strong>, and also,
            <strong>Github</strong> concepts.
          </p>

          <p class="documentation-text">
            We have also started <strong>CSS</strong> and have been able to design a sample news letter using some intermediate-level CSS properties such as the <strong>position</strong> and <strong>z-index</strong> properties.
          </p>

          <p class="documentation-text">
            The tutors<strong>Adaeze</strong> and
            <strong>Ifenna</strong> have been excellent. They have showed great passion towards tutoring us and making sure that everyone is carried along in the learning process.
          </p>

          <p class="documentation-text">
            The <strong>Enugu SME</strong> and their capable program manager <strong>Mr. Salem</strong> and his deputy <strong>Miss. Cynthia</strong> have also demonstrated great capabilities towards running the program effectively.
          </p>

          <p class="documentation-text">
            So far, it has been an exciting experience and I believe it can only get better.
